jj2000
======

Java implementation of the JP2000 standard, duplicated here on GitHub for future reference. See also the  [Archived version of jpeg2000.epfl.ch](http://web.archive.org/web/20100818165144/http://jpeg2000.epfl.ch/).

To use JJ2000, consider switching to [this version of jai-imageio-core](https://github.com/stain/jai-imageio-core), which has been re-packaged for Maven while also stripping out source code with problematic licensing terms.
