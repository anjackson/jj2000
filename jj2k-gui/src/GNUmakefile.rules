# This is the rules makefile for jj2000 project,
# to be included in each package makefile. This makefile
# should NOT be included in the global makefile (global
# building rules would be overriden).
#
# Question or comments: henry@crf.canon.fr
#

#
# All customizations should be done in the 
# "GNUmakefile.var" file.

#Retrieve source files names

REFERENCECLASSFILES=$(addsuffix .class, $(basename $(SOURCEFILES))) 

# The compilation rule assumes that each source file
# contains at least one class that has the same name
# as the basename of the file. This reference class
# file is used to track changes of the source file
