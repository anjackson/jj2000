/**
 * This is the abstract class for writing to a codestream. A codestream
 * corresponds to headers (main and tile-parts) and packets. Each packet has a
 * head and a body. The codestream always has a maximum number of bytes that
 * can be written to it. After that many number of bytes no more data is
 * written to the codestream but the number of bytes is counted so that the
 * value returned by getMaxAvailableBytes() is negative. If the number of
 * bytes is unlimited a ridicoulosly large value, such as Integer.MAX_VALUE,
 * is equivalent.
 *
 * <p>Data writting to the codestream can be simulated. In this case, no byto
 * is effectively written to the codestream but the resulting number of bytes
 * is calculated and returned (although it is not accounted in the bit
 * stream). This can be used in rate control loops.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementing classes should write the header of the bit stream before
 * writing any packets. The bit stream header can be written with the help of
 * the HeaderEncoder class.</p>
