/**
 * This is the generic interface to be implemented by all image file (or other
 * resource) writers for different formats.
 *
 * <p>Each object inheriting from this class should have a source ImgData
 * object associated with it. The image data to write to the file is obtained
 * from the associated ImgData object. In general this object would be
 * specified at construction time.</p>
 *
 * <p>Depending on the actual type of file that is written a call to any
 * write() or writeAll() method will write data from one component, several
 * components or all components. For example, a PGM writer will write data
 * from only one component (defined in the constructor) while a PPM writer
 * will write 3 components (normally R,G,B).</p>
