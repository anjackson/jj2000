 * This class writes a component from an image in 8 bit unsigned data to a
 * binary PGM file. The size of the image that is written to the file is the
 * size of the component from which to get the data, not the size of the
 * source image (they differ if there is some sub-sampling).
 *
 * <P>Before writing, all coefficients are inversly level shifted and then
 * "saturated" (they are limited to the nominal dynamic range).<br> <u>Ex:</u>
 * if the nominal range is 0-255, the following algorithm is applied:<br>
 * <tt>if coeff<0, output=0<br> if coeff>255, output=255<br> else
 * output=coeff</tt>
 *
 * <P>The write() methods of an object of this class may not be called
 * concurrently from different threads.
 *
 * <P>NOTE: This class is not thread safe, for reasons of internal buffering.
