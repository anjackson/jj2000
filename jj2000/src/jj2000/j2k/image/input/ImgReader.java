/**
 * This is the generic interface to be implemented by all image file (or other
 * resource) readers for different image file formats.
 *
 * <P>An ImgReader behaves as an ImgData object. Whenever image data is
 * requested through the getInternCompData() or getCompData() methods, the
 * image data will be read (if it is not buffered) and returned. Implementing
 * classes should not buffer large amounts of data, so as to reduce memory
 * usage.
 *
 * <P>This class sets the image origin to (0,0). All default implementations
 * of the methods assume this.
 *
 * <P>This class provides default implementations of many methods. These
 * default implementations assume that there is no tiling (i.e., the only tile
 * is the entire image), that the image origin is (0,0) in the canvas system
 * and that there is no component subsampling (all components are the same
 * size), but they can be overloaded by the implementating class if need be.
